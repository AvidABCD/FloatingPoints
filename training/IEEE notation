IEEE (754 fp 32 single precision) is a notation that is usually accpeted as the standard way to represnt floating point numbers (doubles or longs).

Within this includes a few key components. To start is the scientific notation that was briefly refrenced last session. This was the idea that all numbers should be 
normalized and as such "1. *******" (* representing further binary numbers). With this, the 1 does not take up a bit but is instead assumed.

Sign: one bit is required to represent the sign of the floating point number - as such 0 represents positive and 1 represents a negative number.

Mantissa - this is the decimal points assigned







Raw Notes ###########
IEEE:

Mantissa - 52 bits for the number
Sign - 1 bit either 0 for positive or 1 for negative
Exponent - 11 bits can represent numbers up to 2048 but is split between negative and positive to represent both exponent sides - must add 1023 to exponent to see what number is actually represented 
-exponent 2047 is infinite or if mantissa all zeros not a number 
Exponent as zero is a very small number 

Rounding happens in the matissa 

Machine epsilon is the distance between 1 and the next smallest representable number

ulps - error from actual - just subtract what is given from actual 

Guard Bits - adds significant figures in order to represent more accurate data - 
For example is subtraction in which numbers will be lost to truncation - guard bits can be used instead to preserve significant figures - these then can be used to modify result to be more accurate 

Catastrophic Cancellation vs Benign Cancellation
Catastrophic - is rounding during the the problem in earlier steps which results in a magnified error in the later steps of the calculation

Benign - no rounding whatsoever during the calculation but a rounding at the end to preserve significant digits
