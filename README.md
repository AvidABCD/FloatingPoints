# FloatingPoints

The goal of this project is to understand the role that floating point numbers play in the world of coding (specifically mathimatical operations).
I hope to understand the margin of error and intend in finding a method to fix this growing issue.

# Research

I hope to conduct sufficient research in order to understand this topic and see where the problem lies. 
Through this I hope to conduct experiments that help me realize and understand the issues taking place.
